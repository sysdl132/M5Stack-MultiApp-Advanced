  ### Using this app, M5Stack can run all included apps without reflashing/rebooting
   #### - This is the continued development of the original M5Stack MultiApp firmware
   #### - This project is made on PlatformIO IDE
   #### - With some minor work it can be adapted to other IDE's like VisualStudio+VisualMicro or Eclipse.

- This project use modifed M5Stack M5StackSAM and EspAudio libraryes from project local storage.
